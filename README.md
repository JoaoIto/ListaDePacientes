The patientes list at the "Aparecida nutricion" clinic, was a project developed at Alura! <i>"JavaScript: Programando na linguagem web!"</i>
<h3>

<p>
The course focuses on JavaScript itself, and developing behaviors to the system and integrating
the static page that exists with <i>HTML</i> e <i>CSS</i>. In the project, there is a table where 
there is a nutritionist's patient list, showing each patient's data individually!
More specifically your name, weight, height, body fat percentage, and your BMI.
